I tried to use this approach to qthreads:
https://mayaposch.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/how-to-really-truly-use-qthreads-the-full-explanation/


BUGS:
text window breaks when it gets too full
seems like data collection warmup delay only works on first collection


TODO:
plot rangest adjustable
    y adjusts automatically?
implement pre-trigger delay
tests: arduino com, imus com, imus self-test, magnetometer
replace sentinels (longer?), or generally better system for com with arduino?
move all plots and their labels to a separate widget
    what else can we move out of am_gui?



FILES:

am_gui.py
main program.
includes am_plot.py, am_rx.py, am_settings.py

am_plot.py
module for plotting data.
i.e. one of the 4 plot windows.

am_rx.py
module for com with arduino.

am_settings.py
module for program settings.

am_tx
directory containing my arduino code and the timer library it uses.

fish_rx.py
this was the first program i wrote for reading data from the arduino.
writes plain text to stdout.
not used by gui.
