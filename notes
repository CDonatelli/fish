I tried to use this approach to qthreads:
https://mayaposch.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/how-to-really-truly-use-qthreads-the-full-explanation/

This is my first forray into pyqt and multi-threading so signals and slots are
kind of wierd, please give any advice. -db


BUGS:


TODO:
tools to adjust plot ranges
implement trigger
tests: arduino com, imus com, imus self-test
replace sentinels (longer?), or generally better system for com with arduino?
get rid of settings winow, move contents to main window



FILES:

am_gui.py
main program.
includes am_plot.py, am_rx.py, am_settings.py

am_plot.py
module for plotting data.
i.e. one of the 4 plot windows.

am_rx.py
module for com with arduino.

am_settings.py
module for program settings.
currently, all of this is in accessed through the settings window.
i plan to get rid of that so this is accessed through the main window.

am_tx
directory containing my arduino code and the timer library it uses.

fish_rx.py
not part of gui main program.
this was the first program i wrote for reading data from the arduino.
writes plain text to stdout.
not used by gui.
